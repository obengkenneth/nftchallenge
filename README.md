## My process
I started with planning how to structure the page with HTML5 before styling with CSS.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I discovered the vertical-align to align with icons with surrounding text.

### Continued development
I plan to research more on how to overlay text over a background image on hover.
